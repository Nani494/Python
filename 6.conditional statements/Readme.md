## Basic Statements - if, elif, else

      a = 5
      b = 6
      if a>b:
        print('a is greater than b')
           
     if a<b:
       print('a is lesser than b')
       
     if a>b:
       print('a is greater than b')
     elif a<b:
       print('b is greater than a')
       
      if a>b:
        print('a is greater than b')
      elif a==b:
        print('b is greater than a')
      else:
        print('no matches found')
        
## True or False Statements
     if True:
       print('yes it is true')
       
     if False
       print('no it is not true')
       
      if True:
        print('A')
      elif False:
        print('B')
      else:
        print('no matches found')
