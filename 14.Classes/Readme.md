Classes are defined as Blueprint or Overall picture, 
Funtions can be called easily with classes names
 
    class func1:          #func1 is name of the class
      def names(self):     #functions defined under classes expects atleast one arguement, here self is the arguement, We can give any name for arguement
        print('kishore')
                   
     a = func1():
     a.names()
