## Sets - Sets are unordered 
    # Sets are defined with curly {}
    
    a = {2, 5.6, True, 'World' 2, 5.6, True, 'World'}
    type(a)
   
    print(a)
    print(a)
    print(a)    #Every time order has been changed, because sets are unordered
                  Also sets avoid duplicate values
    
## Slicing - As we know sets are unordered, Such that it don't have Index
     
     a.pop()  #When we execute pop, it don't remove end item, It can remove any item in set
